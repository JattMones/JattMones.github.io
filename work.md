**Course Work**
Other courses have taught me that computer science depends on the project you're working with. For example, data analytics depends on what  the trend in a specific set of data and how these trends directly relate to our problems. Further, my Programming Languages course taught me the importance of picking the right type of programming language to use for your problem. Other classes I've taken include Algorithm Analysis, Computer Organization, Comp Sci 1&2, and Linear Algebra; along with other classes in calculus, physics, and music.
