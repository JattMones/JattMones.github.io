Hi, my name is Matt Jones and I'm an aspiring computer scientist at Allegheny College. The experience I've gained from courses at Allegheny college have given me proficient skills in many different programming languages (including Imperative, Functional, Object-oriented, and Logic languages). Classes such as software engineering have given me an idea of what a developer's environment is like, the types of problems developers have, how to work working with a customer, and the dynamics of working with a large group on a github project.

**Course Work**
Other courses have taught me that computer science depends on the project you're working with. For example, data analytics depends on what is the trend in this specific set of data, how do these trends directly relate to our problems. Further, my programming languages course taught me the importance of picking the right type of programming language to use for your problem. Other classes I've taken include Algorithm Analysis, Computer Organization, Comp Sci 1&2, and Linear Algebra; along with other classes in calculus, physics, and music.

**Related Work**
Summer work 2018: I helped build a python webscraper which scrapes different websites, collects data, and organizes it into a spreadsheet for users to read and analyze. Currently, I am researching automating user key strokes and clicks for my
