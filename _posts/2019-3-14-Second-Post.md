title: GatorGrader Software Project Progress 
---

In Software Innovation 481, our 4 man team has been addressing issues with the software projects readME and test cases. In particular, we added an additional markdown document that holds information about downloading and installing dependencies for our project, and linked this readME in the main Gator Grader readME.
The test case we added was testing for multi-line python doc strings. Once our team found the correct syntax and regex to identify multiline doc strings (ie. ID-ing multiline doc strings like it identifies the rest of the test cases) we only had to create a the py paramatize code for the doc string and our test case was passing! More information about [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) can be found on github.
