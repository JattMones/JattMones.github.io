title: QuizaGrader Software Project Progress 
---

In Software Innovation 481, our team has been building a interactive quiz website, similar to the web-quiz site Sakai. In particular, we were tasksed with learning about flask, and creating a csv file upload section to the site to allow teachers to add quiz questions this way. 
One of our team members, Josh, used flask in his senior comp, so we were able to build off of his code. It was challenging understand and re-structuring his code to fit our project, but once that was done, the site started to seem like "the real deal". Although we are working 
on finishing touches still QuizaGator, we have laid the foundation for future contributors to add styling, testing and code coverage, tutorials and examples, and any other additional features/bug fixes they wish to implement. Additional information about [Quizagator](https://github.com/GatorEducator/quizagator) can be found on Github.
