<title>About</title>
<div>
 <p>I’ve always loved problem solving and technology. For this reason I’m interested in Computer Science and it’s advancement. So, when I moved to Meadville PA to start undergrad., what better to study than Computer Science? Before Meadville, I moved often and grew up all over the USA. Throughout grade-school and high-school, I lived in Rochester NY, Fort Knox KY, Mechanicsburgh PA, St. Louis MO, and Seattle WA.</p>
